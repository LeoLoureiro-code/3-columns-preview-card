## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

In this project I practice how to use flexbox more efficiently and how to work using mobile-first approach.

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to use CSS grid instead of flexbox to practice more with that technique, in addition add more javascript to my projects.
